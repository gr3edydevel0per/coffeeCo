<p>Developing a website is not a difficult task for me; I have developed many websites earlier.
The most challenging part for me is the design aspect, where I lack expertise the most. 
If I have to build a website, I will spend 3 to 4 days only thinking about the design, and then I will keep refining the design during the development phase.
Talking about this website, I have been working on it since last semester but did not get the opportunity to work on it further. Currently, I have built it for 
larger screen sizes, but with time, I will fix it for smaller screen sizes.
Besides the design challenge, another challenge I faced was searching for the right assets. I had to search for many images, GIFs, and SVGs, which was the 
most horrible part. Searching was a problem in itself, but looking at a large number of assets simultaneously created confusion, ultimately leading to delays.
